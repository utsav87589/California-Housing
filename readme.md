# California - Housing

- California housing price is a regression problem based dataset. Here we are given different features, on which our target feature 'median_house_price' depends on. 
- The dataset is medium size with 20k rows and 10 columns.
- v1 and v2 are two different versions of the project.


### ============= v1 =========================


- v1 is the older version of the project, it has no src files and dedicated portion for all the reusable code. 
- earlier there was no v1 and v2, but during the time v2 was formed, all the older files were moved into the new folder 'v1', so v1 is technically the older version of the project.

====> limitations : 

- No proper folder structure of the files
- src files not used
- code is mostly repititive and all of the code is in Jupyter notebooks
- lack of proper project structure



### ============= v2 =========================

- v2 is the latest version of the project, which is updated timely and covers all the limitations of the v1, it has the dedicated folder from reporting to docs to src files.
- v2 also introduces the Flowcharts which makes it easier to understand the structure of the project.
