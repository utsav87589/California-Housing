# California - Housing
-This dataset is a classic regression problem, It's another end to end project in my list, 
-Will start off with the FE and EDA, the will do the ML predictions with various algorithms and
-Then finally the Unsupervised ML

### Day 1 update

-setting up the project, files
-first look at the data

### Day 2 update

-started FE, EDA part and handled the categorical feature(only one in this dataset)
-made the new columns with the correlation

### Day 3 update

-featured enginerring finished, clean copy for tree made
-copy for the distance based algo half done

### Day 4 update

-copy for the distance based algos done
-setup for the model testing also done, one already tested(baseline check)

### Day 5 update

-tree based model preidctions done,
-problem occured for the scaler for the distance based models, fix tomorrow

### Day 6 update

-fixed the scaler
-all the predictions done, including the ANN as well

### Day 7 update

-finished the preidctions after swapping the datasets, i.e, scaling for tree and vice versa
-Hypothesis confirmed for why distance based models rely on scaling and tree do not

### Day 8 update

-finished the Unsupvised ML part
-only reports left
